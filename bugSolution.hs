The solution involves using the `force` function from the `Control.DeepSeq` library to ensure the strict evaluation of the list elements before filtering.  This forces the evaluation of every element, preventing the infinite loop.

```haskell
import Control.DeepSeq

filterEven :: (Integral a) => [a] -> [a]
filterEven xs = filter even $ force xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ filterEven [2,4,6,8]
  print $ filterEven [1,3,5 ++ [1..]] -- This will now terminate
```

By adding `force xs`, we explicitly evaluate the list `xs` before applying the `filter` function. This modification ensures that the program terminates even when encountering an odd number followed by an infinite list.
