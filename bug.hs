This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The function `filterEven` aims to filter out even numbers from a list. However, due to lazy evaluation, the program will never terminate if the input list contains an odd number followed by an infinite list of numbers.  The problem lies in that the `filter` function processes elements lazily and only evaluates when an element is needed.  If it hits an odd number followed by an infinite list, it will never reach the end of the filtering process.
